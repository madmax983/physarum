//! Physarum: a slime mold grown in a `SQLite` fleet split between hosts.
//!
//! One binary, two roles. `physarum-app host` is a host: a tenant fleet,
//! one tenant per cell of the dish, with ownership and replication, and two
//! batch endpoints ([`host`]). `physarum-app` alone is the console: it
//! starts and stops hosts as child processes and grows the mold through them
//! ([`console`]).
